## Overview

As The Odin Project claims, this is about building a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. Being such a simple but challenging assignment, I chose to previously design a minimalistic approach for the UI.

I wanted to build a project that resembles some of the nowadays software interfaces like Photoshop, Figma or Microsoft Paint 10. Even though at first I will try to build fewer tools just for the sake of completing it, I would like to keep adding more features and transform it into a cool sketching software.

## The Challenge

- [ ] Build a browser version of etch-a-sketch
- [ ] Put in practice those googling skills
- [ ] Set up the 'hovering' effect in the grid
- [ ] Add a Rainbow feature for colorful painting
- [ ] Implement the Figma Design
- [ ] Have fun

### Understand the problem

- How are we going to create the grid with javascript?
  - Create grid-container in html
  - Select grid-container in javascript
  - Create a variable for pixel size = 16;
  - Create function for creating a div and append it to the grid-container
  - Use a for loop to create and push those grids inside the grid-container
    - Append divs into the grid until (pixel size \* pixel size);
- How are we going to arrange div's as a grid?
  - Let's try with flex-box wrap
- How are we going to create the hover effect?
  - how to create an event listener for hovering?
    - With "mouseover"
  - How to create an event listener for when the mouse leaves?
- How to change the color of the divs?
  - Using classes and adding them each time the event happens
- How to make the rainbow brush?
  - Create a function that adds 3 random numbers between 0 and 255, and add those values with a template literal to the background-color of a class "rainbow"
